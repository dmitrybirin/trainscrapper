##Train ticket scrapper

Simple node.js app, that browse to the RZD site and scrap the tickets data without exploiting their not open API.

###Install
You will need node and npm installed as well as mongodb. 
Then "npm install" should do the magic

It works on the Nightmare.js underhood, so it will get electron with it. 
I'll rid of it in the future.
